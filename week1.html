              <h3>For this assignment, the first thing that came to my head was to force my self to code
                every part of the web page. That would give me total control over the site and updating would
                be easier. With that in mind, I would be needing to learn html code.</h3>
              <h3>I went then to CodeAcademy.com. I have been learning Javascrip in the past with great pleasure, so went
                back to check their HTML courses. After several hours with in-web practice, I was ready to try with my own website.</h3>

          <h2>Editor selection</h2>
            <h3>I have some experience with coding, so I was thinking in using my installed editor for web code.
            It is TextWrangler, which is installed in my Macbookpro. It's a very simple editor but enought for simple task.
             I tried for a while, but I wasn't getting confortable with it. That's when decided to look for something else.
             My search lead me to Atom editor. It is a simple but powerfull program with a very autopilot UI. In a couple of hours,
             I was working with no problems. I even installed a preview addon, that let me see my html display in real time. Very helpful.</h3>

          <h2>Web Develop</h2>
          <h3>The hardest part of the job was making everything works from ground. With no template for reference,
            I could only look in internet for several websites and check their source code to learn the "good practice".
            Even with CodeAcademy open, finding why my text doesn't get into position was very frustrating in the beginning.
            It is after several tries that I could make the layout for the home page, but the nightmare wasn't over. Learning that
            it is important to make a good template is what will save time in the future. Even now I think my web will need a lot
            of more improvement. </h3>

          <h2>Git time!</h2>
          <h3>With my experience in game development, knowing how to deal with git was simple. Once you understand what happens when you
            pull info and how to commit every change, you have learned (in my opinion) 70% to 80% of the git model.
            One thing that I didn't know was how to deploy a website using git. Some people was telling me that should use git to connect
            to the repository. Because I also use a Mac, I could not use that option, instead downloaded Git Kraken for the job. No problems at all.</h3>
