           <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <h3>For this week assignment we have to work with 2D/3D CAD tools in order to learn how to use them. I will be using Dassault Solidworks (explained why next) to model a very simple
                Car for my temptative proyect. The proyect (for now) its going to be a radio control car attached with a camera and following a reference in order to let the owner to set the distance and the angle
                from which the car is going to follow. </h3>

          <h2>2D/3D software selection</h2>
            <h3>I have worked with Autodeks Inventor for a long time due my job. I used to work in a Mechanical Desing area so I'm used to do pieces and assemblies with 3D software.
               Also I had to work with Autodesk AutoCAD in some cases when other collaborators need info in DWG format. In both cases, those are very powerful tools, but Autodesk Inventor is stronger than AutoCAD
               thanks to the ability to assembly pieces and make object oriented drawings.</h3>

              <h3>Other software that I tried were Autodesk Fusion, Autodesk Alias, Rinoceros, 123D, etc. I will not used them during this week
               because I'm thinking in a parametric design and some of those tools are better suited for freeform work. Some good for piece design but lack assembly features.
               </h3>

               <h3>In the 2D plane, I like to sketch my ideas with pen and paper, then model it in Inventor</h3>

               <h3>For this assignment, I will try to use another well know software just to try it. I'm going to use Dassault Solidworks with its Educational format</h3>

          <h2>First try with Solidworks</h2>
          <h3>I'm trying Solidworks without a guide. I feel confident that my kwnoledge with Inventor will led me to get a piece modeled.</h3>
          <h3>The first thing I did was try the navigation tools. Pan, Zoom, rotate... This are absolutely necesary tools you need to get used to because you will be doing the 95% of the time when modeling.
          The buttons in the mouse were different to Inventor but managed to memorize some and the others could be changed with a quick google search (googled how to change some buttons)</h3>
          <h3>I tried then to model a piece. Started a new piece file and looked for the Sketch. Draw some lines and then constrained. After set the dimensions, drew other sketch in different planes to form the car body
          with the loft operation. Then drew some circles in one face to represent the holes where the wheels going to be. Finally used the mirror feature to duplicate my work. For files download <a href="Files\Assignment2\CuerpoCarro.SLDPRT" download> SLDPRT</a>
        and <a href="Files\Assignment2\CuerpoCarro.STL" download> STL</a> </h3>

          <h2>Second Try</h2>
          <h3>For the second try, I'm going to model a wheel. This time going to use extrude and fillet operations. First draw one circle (80mm diameter) in the plane, and then extrude it(20 mm). When having
          the cilinder, use the fillet command to give each edge a 10 mm radius fillet. Finally draw one circle in the center of the wheel to make a hole. For files download <a href="Files\Assignment2\Rueda.SLDPRT" download> SLDPRT</a>
