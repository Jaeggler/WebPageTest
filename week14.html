          <h2>Test</h2>
            <h3> Decided to work with fiber glass since was the easiest fiber could buy from stores.</h3>
            <h3> Once I got my material, ran 2 test (coupons) to learn how to handle the fiberglass. My first coupon was just adding 2 little squares of material together with the resin
            (general use resin) and my second test was using a plastic mold to check how material adapts to circular forms. In both cases, first apllied a layer of resin and with the wet resin
          add one layer of fiber, second . Repeated the process to get the second layer </h3>
            <h3>After one night, I got both test looking good</h3>

            <h3>Comments</h3>
            <h3>I been working in my house, using gloves, glasses and a overall. Since the beginning, noticed the fiber gets everywhere so its important to do little cleaning for time to time</h3>
            <h3>Even wearing mask, security glasses and overall I got material in my troath. I think it happened when took out my mask and some fibers may be floating</h3>
            <h3>Working with the fiber isn't hard, but need to be really organized to avoid having  fiber all over the place.</h3>

            <h2>Base Design</h2>
              <h3>I wanted to do a mask for this assignment, so I used a balloon and newsprint paper to make the base. </h3>
              <h3>With a solution of water and glue I lay it on the ballon and then add pieces of paper, then add solution again to make the first layer to stick better and add the second one.</h3>
              <h3>After 5 layers, left the ballon to dry.</h3>
              <h3>Comments</h3>
              <h3>I think used too much solution. It took 2 days with cold weather to dry completely.</h3>

          <h2>Adding composite</h2>
            <h3>After the ballon dried, cut the fiberglass mat in small pieces for maximum adapt to the baloon shape. Then, after setting my workspace, started to add resin to the mask and the fiberglass. </h3>
            <h3>Added 2 layers of fiberglass while pressing it with a small roller, then left to dry when all air is out. While drying, cleaned my workspace to avoid other people inhalate the fiberglass.</h3>

            <h2>Result</h2>
              <h3>After dry, the mask is really solid. Even when not using a pressure technique, fiberglass hardens really nice. </h3>
              <h3>Tried to cut the eyehole when still wet beacuase read when is hard, would be impossible. So cut one eyehole and left the other one for testing cutting while hard.</h3>

              <h3>Final comments</h3>
              <h3>Could not cut the other eye. Its too hard to let the cutter to go through.</h3>
              <h3>I will do a second proyect closer to the model I want. But this time I will use natural fibers because working with fiberglass in my house feels kind of dangerous to my family. Even
              cleaning and taking lots of care, some fibers float and keep that way, being dangerous to the kids here.</h3>
