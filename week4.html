              This version is Brian's FabISP model, using a ATtiny45 chip.</h3>

           <h3>Comments</h3>
            <h3>This assigment was difficult for me because I donÂ´t have much electronics background. Took me some time to understand why we were using Brian's model and no other. Also
            some people decided to modify their model making hard to me deciding. Some hours later took my decision and start to mill the PCB folliwing Brian's model guide.</h3>

            <h3>Milling</h3>
            <h3>Beacuse we already have the milling traces, al we have to learn was to use the machine. In our FabLab we have a Modela mill connected to a Ubuntu PC. Learned how to load and send
            the trace file to the modela. Also learnead how to set the machine to start milling. </h3>

            <h3>Cutting</h3>
            <h3>I could only have the traces milled but could not cut the shape with the mill, that why had to cut it with a tool. I was taught that have to heat the board before cut it, because
            it could break and damage the traces. After some hot air, I had my board ready to soldering </h3>

            <h3>Comments</h3>
            <h3>
              A simple task sending files, using known parameters, there is no problems any person can work with the software but it is important to try several times how to set the machine origin
              ir order to avoid any tool break.
             </h3>
             <h3>
               The hardest part of this assignment for me was cutting the board. I had to mill 3 times before having my final board, first because breaked the board with the cutting tool, and second
               due bad board fixation. And when finally had my final board, almost break it again. Think I would have to train harder with the cutting tool.

          <h3>Comments</h3>
          <h3>I took a couple of hours to find the appropriate soldering technique. It is something you need to try for your self and can't be read in a book. </h3>
