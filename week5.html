              <h3>In this workgroup we printed different diameter spheres, both in resin and filament. We were looking for difference in finishing, weight, strenght, accuracy and support creation.
              We used a Stratasys Objet 30 and Makerbot printer for resin (Vero Material) and filament (ABS filament). Here are the results></h3>
              <h3><ul>
                <li>Finishing: Resin materials are really beatifull. The Objet30 prints thickness down to 26Âµ, allowing to have smooth organic surface. On the other hand, filament material
                is not the best option for complex surface having rought surface and a stair-like form.</li>
                <li>Weight: Here filament is the best. The Objet 30 printer doesn't allow to create inner structures (like filament does) to reduce material consumption but a solid piece,
                   this makes this kind of technology really expensive. Even if we design the piece to have an inner structure to save some material, this "hole" would be filled with support material,
                 in this case, a gel-like material</li>
