            <h3>It was a very hard week. Usually I need to understand what I'm doing before actually do it. I could not figure out the board output, and adding (LED + button) something I don't understand
            was something that grinds my gears. So I tried to simulate the board with Autodesk 123 Circuit but it couldn't be done. </h3>
            <h3>Finally I found the guide, and everything was smooth.</h3>

          <h2>Milling</h2>
            <h3>After I finished with PCB design, I exported the PNG file for milling. This part was tricky because my first board was not the dimension I wanted, it was larger!
              some reasearch after that, I found how to measure my board on Eagle and then resized the canvas/file. When I was sure dimensions were fine, only thing left to do was adding
               a "W6" as text, refering to week 6 assignment.</h3>
            <h3>Setting the Modela mill was easier this time. Loaded my file, set it-s origin and mill started and finish correctly.</h3>
            <h3>Comments</h3>
            <h3>Finding why my board png file had that dimensions took some time. I was thinking the program will keep origin's dimension but created based on pixel output (500 for this work).
            Some test and finally got the right dimensions for my work</h3>
            <h3>I was suggested to change some routes width, because the machine was not recognizing the space between some routes. A quick change and those routes were changed from 0.016" to 0.01" </h3>
