          <h2>2D/3D software selection</h2>
            <h3>I have worked with Autodeks Inventor for a long time due my job. I used to work in a Mechanical Desing area so I'm used to do pieces and assemblies with 3D software.
               Also I had to work with Autodesk AutoCAD in some cases when other collaborators need info in DWG format. In both cases, those are very powerful tools, but Autodesk Inventor is stronger than AutoCAD
               thanks to the ability to assembly pieces and make object oriented drawings.</h3>

              <h3>Other software that I tried were Solidworks, Autodesk Alias, Rinoceros, 123D, etc. I will not used them during this week
               because I'm thinking in a parametric design and some of those tools are better suited for freeform work. Some good for piece design but lack assembly features (except for Solidworks which is a powefull 3D software, being Inventor long-last rival).
               </h3>

               <h3>For this assignment, I will be selecting Autodesk Fusion. My selection is based in 2 things: Similarity with Autodesk Inventor, which is a tool I already know; and free license. </h3>

               <h3>Fusion have powerful features for hobbist and startups, so I think it will serve by far the needs. </h3>

          <h2>3D Design</h2>
          <h3>The good thing about Fusion it have lot of material to learn with built-in or in Youtube. You can learn from their own channel in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiMwMz3RMbW5mbx0iDcRQ2g">link</a></h3>
          <h3>When learning to design with 3D is good to start with this topics: Navigation tools (how to move the piece and the enviroment to better design), Sketching(The 2D draws that will turn into 3D), 3D Operations(Extrude, Roll, chanfer, etc)
          and finally Assembly(How to connect different pieces or different assemblies to create and operating mechanism). In my case I will review each one with Fusion</h3>
          <h3>In my experience, the first thing to define is: "Which going to be my final assembly?" and "how many sub-assemblies it going to have?". Having that in mind, I will start doing two pieces: the hand and the "fingers".
            On the left is the video with the hand and finger design I made to test the software.</h3>
            <h3></h3>

            <h2>3D Design Process</h2>
            <h3>Similar to Inventor, first we need to do a sketch. One thing different from Inventor is you probably will be working on the same file. You will be creating components directly
            to the assembly. So I create the the sketch for the hand and and extrude it.</h3>
            <h3>Once I have my first solid, need to add details. Used the chamfer command to reduce pointy edges and another sketch to create the finger slot. Also draw a point for later finger join.</h3>
            <h3>Finally, creating the finger (with similar process as before), used the Joint command to attach it to the hand. Video will show the steps made.</h3>
