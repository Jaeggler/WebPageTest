           <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <h3>For this week assignment we have to work with 2D/3D CAD tools in order to learn how to use them. I will be using Autodesk Fusion (explained why next) to model the concept for my project.
                The project (for now) its going to be a "scratchy hand" for people who likes to have their heads scratched before sleep.</h3>

          <h2>2D/3D software selection</h2>
            <h3>I have worked with Autodeks Inventor for a long time due my job. I used to work in a Mechanical Desing area so I'm used to do pieces and assemblies with 3D software.
               Also I had to work with Autodesk AutoCAD in some cases when other collaborators need info in DWG format. In both cases, those are very powerful tools, but Autodesk Inventor is stronger than AutoCAD
               thanks to the ability to assembly pieces and make object oriented drawings.</h3>

              <h3>Other software that I tried were Solidworks, Autodesk Alias, Rinoceros, 123D, etc. I will not used them during this week
               because I'm thinking in a parametric design and some of those tools are better suited for freeform work. Some good for piece design but lack assembly features (except for Solidworks which is a powefull 3D software, being Inventor long-last rival).
               </h3>

               <h3>For this assignment, I will be selecting Autodesk Fusion. My selection is based in 2 things: Similarity with Autodesk Inventor, which is a tool I already know; and free license. </h3>

               <h3>Fusion have powerful features for hobbist and startups, so I think it will serve by far the needs. </h3>

          <h2>3D Design Process</h2>
          <h3>The good thing about Fusion it have lot of material to learn with built-in or in Youtube. You can learn from their own channel in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiMwMz3RMbW5mbx0iDcRQ2g">link</a></h3>
          <h3>When learning to design with 3D is good to start with this topics: Navigation tools (how to move the piece and the enviroment to better design), Sketching(The 2D draws that will turn into 3D), 3D Operations(Extrude, Roll, chanfer, etc)
          and finally Assembly(How to connect different pieces or different assemblies to create and operating mechanism). In my case I will review each one with Fusion</h3>
          <h3>In my experience, the first thing to define is: "Which going to be my final assembly?" and "how many sub-assemblies it going to have?". Having that in mind, I will start doing two pieces: the hand and the "fingers".
            On the left is the video with the hand and finger design.
          <h3> The files are the files to download: <a href="Files\week2\hand.stp" download>Hand.stp</a> and <a href="Files\week2\finger.step" download> finger.stp </a> </h3>
